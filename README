* SurpriseMe - An integrated tool for network community structure
characterization using Surprise maximization * 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

SurpriseMe is a free, open source software for detecting community structure
in networks. The program uses Surprise to evaluate the outputs of 7 high-
quality community detection algorithms. It also generates distance matrices
that allow to visualize the relationships among the solutions generated.

Compilation
===========

Note: The code should compile in any Linux distribution using its basic,
standard libraries (g++, make...).


Unzip the tar.gz file and enter the directory:

  tar -xvzf SurpriseMe.tar.gz
  cd SurpriseMe

Build and compile the program:

  make



Usage
=====

Once the program is compiled, just run:

  ./SurpriseMe.pl networkFile
  
where networkFile is the file containing the network to be analyzed.
Each line of network_file should be of the form

  id_1 id_2

if node with id_1 is connected with node with id_2. Links are assumed 
bidirectional, so that if id_1 id_2 is present in networkFile then 
id_2 id_1 should not be present. Some examples of this format can be
seen in the net_examples folder.


Example:
./SurpriseMe net_examples/sample.pairs



Output files
=============

The execution of the program creates the following files:

- networkFile.S			Contains the value of Surprise for the 
				solution of each algorithm.
				
- networkFile_algorithm.part	Partition obtained by an algorithm.
				Each line contains the name of a node
				and its corresponding community
				
- networkFile_VI.meg		MEGA (www.megasoftware.net) input file.
				Contains the distance matrix of all
				solutions. Uses the Variation of
				Information as a distance between partitions.
				
- networkFile_1-NMI.meg		MEGA (www.megasoftware.net) input file.
				Contains the distance matrix of all
				solutions. Uses (1 minus the Normalized
				Mutual Information) as a distance between
				partitions.
				

How to run only certain algorithms
==================================

You can modify line 27 in SurpriseMe.pl in order to run only a few algorithms.
By default, the program runs all of them. Just remove from the array @algs
those you want to exclude from the analysis.
